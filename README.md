This Project is iReporter

Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and
localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables
any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the
general public.

iReporter gives you a voice, you can get the attention of necessary authorities 
by raising a red flag or creating an intervention on any incident in your community.
Incidents ranges from corruption to cultism, drug rings, terrorists cell and so on.
You can also report on damaged infrastructures posing threat to the safety of the people,
e.g building about to collapse, bad roads, collapse bridges e.t.c
